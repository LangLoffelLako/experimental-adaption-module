# Experimental Adaption Module

The Experimental Adaption Module was a short proof-of-concept of a sentences difficulty selection based on a
data file with sentences and difficulty ratings. It creates vectorized sentences and pushes a player model as a vector 
around in the vectore space to select the next appropriate sentence.

##Installation

You have to set it up manually.

## Usage

You need the following packages to run the programm:
```python
import scipy
import numpy as np
import pandas as pd
import sent2vec.vectorizer import Vectorizer
import pandas as pd
import time
```

## Contributing
This is only a proof of concept, if you want to use it for whatever purpose you can fork it.
